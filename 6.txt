Don’t take the wrong program for your career goals, like the student who wanted to become a teacher but took a program designed to end up in service industry. Check with the career counseling department to be sure the major you pick is on the track to the career you want Extra Pointer. There are many careers for which any one of a number of undergraduate majors would be appropriate. Don't box yourself into a major you don't like, thinking (wrongly) that it's the only path to your career of choice. You don't have to major in business to go on in business (many business people majored in a variety of sciences fields).<br><br>
